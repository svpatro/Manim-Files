# Manim Files
Using the [Manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim) library by 3Blue1Brown, I created some of my own animations. All files in the scenes folder were custom created by me!

To render out the videos via CLI (Command-Line interface), use the following command:

`manim -p -qh [Target File] [Class Scene]`

Example: `manim -p -qh LinkedList.py OpeningText`
